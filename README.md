dirqueue
===

Dirqueue is a filesystem based, persistent queue in Scala. It's intended to accommodate message passing between processes, without the receiving process to be running all the time.

There is a `Queue` interface trait, and a single implementation: `DirectoryBackedQueue`. The `Queue` interface has only two methods: `enqueue(elem: E): String` and `dequeue(): Option[E]`. The `dequeue` method returns a `None` if the queue is empty and a `Some` if there is an element.

Quick start
-----------

Add to your `build.sbt`:

    resolvers += "Lunatech Public Releases" at "http://artifactory.lunatech.com/artifactory/releases-public"
    
    libraryDependencies += "com.lunatech" %% "dirqueue" % "0.1"

usage
-----

A `com.lunatech.queue.Serializable` typeclass intance is required for the element type that is queued. An instance for `String` is provided.

The backing directory must already exist.

Producer:

    val directory = File("./my-backing-dir").toPath
    val queue = DirectoryBackedQueue[String](directory)
    queue.enqueue("foo")

Consumer:

    val directory = File("./my-backing-dir").toPath
    val queue = DirectoryBackedQueue[String](directory)
    queue.deqeuue.map { element =>
      // We've got an element
    }

Development
-----------

 * Build with `sbt compile`
 * Generate Scaladoc with `sbt doc`
 * Run tests with `sbt test`
